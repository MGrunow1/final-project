            <h1>Michael Grunow's Nature Page</h1>
            <p>
                I have grown up taking walks, looking at scenery and listening to the sounds of birds. However, I do not have to travel far to see a bird on a fence, or to look at the shape of a cloud (at least, when the sky has clouds). I still prefer to get out to a park, where I can see a greater variety of wildlife and plants, yet I can enjoy nature's beauty wherever I am.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love to identify the plants and animals that I see, and continue to learn to recognize more. I may take along multiple books for identifying things (trees, beetles, spiders), as well as binoculars.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy photography. Mostly, I take pictures of landscapes, but I will also take photos of flowers or mushrooms, or anything close enough for me to get a decent picture. Sometimes I have videoed a walk, and recorded sounds.
