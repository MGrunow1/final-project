            <p>
                I have grown up taking walks, looking at scenery and listening to the sounds of birds. However, I do not have to travel far to see a bird on a fence, or to look at the shape of a cloud (at least, when the sky has clouds). I still prefer to get out to a park, where I can see a greater variety of wildlife and plants, yet I can enjoy nature's beauty wherever I am.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are some examples of things I have seen and heard:

                    This is some type of scarab beetle on a monkeyflower. I saw it in April 2019, by White Rock Road in Mariposa County, California. Scarab beetles have a lopsided "club" shape at the tips of the antennae. Click on the image to view a larger version.

                    This dragonfly was perched on the wall by the garage of the house where I live, in April 2019. It is one of the group of dragonflies known as "darners." Darners are usually large, and many are brown with small blue spots. They are called "darners" because some people think that they are shaped like darning needles (large sewing needles for mending).

                    This is the song of an American robin I heard in June 2015. It was at El Dorado Trail in Amador County, California.

                    This is the sound of Pacific chorus frogs. I recorded this in February 2016, in Morgan Territory Regional Preserve in Contra Costa County, California. There were many frogs in shallow water, among small reeds. Pacific chorus frogs are tiny, but they can make a lot of noise. Caution: this audio may be loud!

                    These clouds were in the sky over Stanislaus National Forest, in July of 2021. As far as I can tell, the larger, closer clouds (in the lower left) were cumulus clouds, and the small clouds were altocumulus. (The altocumulus clouds only look small because they are further up in the sky.) Click on the image to view a larger version.

                    This fungus is called "orange mock oyster". I saw it in February 2021, at Huddart Park in San Mateo County, California. (Thanks to my brother for helping me identify it.) Orange mock oyster grows on decaying wood, especially oak. Click on the image to view a larger version.
