            <h1>About Michael</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Michael Grunow. I love to identify the plants and animals that I see, and continue to learn to recognize more. Often, I take along multiple books for identifying things (trees, beetles, spiders), as well as binoculars for looking at birds. I like to take walks with my parents and my brother, and together we identify what we see.
            </p>

                I enjoy photography. Mostly, I take pictures of landscapes, but I will also take photos of flowers or mushrooms, or anything close enough for me to get a decent picture. Sometimes I have videoed a walk, and recorded sounds.

            <p>
                All the sound recordings on this website are taken out of videos that I recorded, and all the photos were taken by me (Michael Grunow). The landscape photo at the top of the home page, was taken at Corteva Wetlands Preserve, in March 2022. The photo of Canada geese used in the footer was from Pacific Commons Linear Park in Fremont, California (Alameda County), taken back in January of 2011.
