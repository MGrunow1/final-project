            <h1>Michael Grunow's Nature Page</h1>
            <p>
                I have grown up taking walks, looking at scenery and listening to the sounds of birds. However, I do not have to travel far to see a bird on a fence, or to look at the shape of a cloud (at least, when the sky has clouds). I still prefer to get out to a park, where I can see a greater variety of wildlife and plants, yet I can enjoy nature's beauty wherever I am.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are some examples of things I have seen and heard:

                    This is some type of scarab beetle on some monkeyflower. I saw it in April 2019, by White Rock Road in Mariposa County, California. Hover over the image to view it larger.

                    This dragonfly was perched on the wall by the garage of the house where I live, in April 2019. It is one of the group of dragonflies known as "darners." Hover over the image to view it larger.

                    This is the song of an American robin I heard in June 2015. It was at El Dorado Trail in Amador County, California.

                    This is the sound of Pacific chorus frogs. I recorded this in February 2016, in Morgan Territory Regional Preserve in Contra Costa County, California. Caution: may be loud!
